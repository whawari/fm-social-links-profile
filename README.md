## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This project was easy for me. I learned how to use Tailwind's color opacity modifier.

### Continued development

I am currently learning Tailwind CSS, and I plan to continue refining my skills with it for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Cheat Sheet](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/cheatsheet) - This helped me to quickly find Tailwind CSS classes needed for this challenge. I really liked the simplicity of the cheat sheet and will continue using it until I get a good grasp of Tailwind CSS classes.
- [Tailwind CSS Text Color Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color#changing-the-opacity) - This helped me to learn how to use the color opacity modifier to control the opacity of an element's text/background color.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - I used this color palette generator to generate a personalized color for this project. 
- [Tailwind CSS Color Generator](https://uicolors.app/create) - I used this color generator to create a custom color scale.
